A push of all annotations gathered through time from the QUAERO project.

Annotations concern either the RWC Popular, Eurovision or QUAERO datasets, and are either chord or structure annotations.

This project was conducted by F. Bimbot et al. [1], and the repositories are intended not to lose the content of the project.

TODO: Clean the different subfolders.
